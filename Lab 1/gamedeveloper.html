<p id="firstp" class="paragraphs">When going into the field of software development, there are several careers that your skills may be applicable to. One that is of most interest to me is Video game Development. Video Game Development is the process of creating video games. A game developer can be as simple as one person who does all the work for one game or as intricate as a large business with different people with different responsibilities working on multiple games. Some of the work involved is programming, design art, testing, and much more.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">As a Game Developer, it is possible for you to specialize in a specific video game console, such as Nintendo, Playstation, or Xbox, but it is also possible to work on a different number of systems including mobile devices. Typically, you would focus on one genre of game. For example you may work on primarily role playing games and will continue developing RPGS as you continue your career. There is also an option to work on porting games from one system to another, which means translating games from one language to another. This is how you're able to play the same game on multiple platforms.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Video game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals as common work attire. Many workers find this type of environment rewarding and pleasant professionally and personally. However, the industry also requires long working hours from its employees. Employee burnout is not uncommon.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">The median salary for game developers is about $68,000 for the United States. The values change based on location. While the pay level is not bad, that is not the reason most people get into game development. Due to the long work hours, tedious detail, and brutal deadlines, game developing is really best suited for someone who is very passionate about the career.</p>
